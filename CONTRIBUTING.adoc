Thank you so much for wanting to contribute to browser-telemetry ! Here are a few important things you should know about contributing:

  1. API changes require discussion, use cases, etc. Code comes later.
  2. Pull requests are great for small fixes for bugs, documentation, etc.
  3. Code contributions require updating relevant documentation.

This project takes all contributions through https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests[pull requests].
Code should *not* be pushed directly to `master`.

The following guidelines apply to all contributors.

== Making Changes
* Fork the `browser-telemetry` repository
* Make your changes and push them to a topic branch in your fork
* See our commit message guidelines further down in this document
* Submit a pull request to the repository
* Update `browser-telemetry` GITHUB issue with the generated pull request link

== General Guidelines
* Only one logical change per commit
* Do not mix whitespace changes with functional code changes
* Do not mix unrelated functional changes
* When writing a commit message:
    ** Describe _why_ a change is being made
    ** Do not assume the reviewer understands what the original problem was
    ** Do not assume the code is self-evident/self-documenting
    ** Describe any limitations of the current code
* Any significant changes should be accompanied by tests.
* The project already has good test coverage, so look at some of the existing tests if you're unsure how to go about it.
* Please squash all commits for a change into a single commit (this can be done using `git rebase -i`).

== Commit Message Guidelines
* Provide a brief description of the change in the first line.
* Insert a single blank line after the first line
* Provide a detailed description of the change in the following lines, breaking
 paragraphs where needed.
* The first line should be limited to 50 characters and should not end in a
 period.
* Subsequent lines should be wrapped at 72 characters.
* Put `Closes #XXX` line at the very end (where `XXX` is the actual issue number) if the proposed change is relevant to a tracked issue.

Note: In Git commits the first line of the commit message has special significance. It is used as the email subject line, in git annotate messages, in gitk viewer annotations, in merge commit messages and many more places where space is at a premium. Please make the effort to write a good first line!
